Forrest Mims III is an amateur scientist that has had many achievements
 like helping a weather company make their information correct after it 
 randomly started going off course. He also made many simple projects 
 with the 555 microchip, like timers, sound synthesizers, and others.
He mainly encourages amateur science, which includes simple projects 
with electronics that just about anybody can make. He also encourages 
“citizen science” which means that anybody can go out to their local 
park and just simply observe and measure things and write them down. 
He also wrote many books on this topic, which were sold at RadioShack
 and started getting thousands of people interested. The case with most
  people was that those books were the reason that they got a job.
   Forrest Mims has written about 75 books, which got millions of
    copies sold. These books were mainly “engineer’s mini-notebooks”
     which had simple diagrams of different circuits and projects. Among
      these was my project, the Atari Punk console. This is what the first
       editions of these books looked like:</p>

<p>I used one of the projects from his book to learn about how to 
read the schematics, and about electronic components.
