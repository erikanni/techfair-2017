		<p>
Hans Camezind was a Swedish engineer who moved to America
 in 1960. He wrote three books and created the 555 timer.
  The 555 timer easily became very popular and about a billion are produced per year.
His books were mainly about electronics and itâ€™s history. 
Later, Forrest Mims III would publish numerous books with 
projects using the 555 microchip and start the careers of thousands.</p>

<h4>Facts about the 555 timer IC</h4>


<ul>
<li>Over a billion produced each year</li>
<li>Invented in 1971</li>
<li>Consists of 25 transistors, 2 diodes, and 15 resistors</li>
<li>Has three operating modes: Bistable, Astable, and Monostable</li>
<li>Can be used to provide time delays, as an oscillator, 
and as a flip-flop element</li>

</ul>
