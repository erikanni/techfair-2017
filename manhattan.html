		<p>
Manhattan Style refers to a style of soldering in which small, 
metal plates are glued onto a copper plate and all of the pieces
 are interconnected this way. If a piece is connected to ground,
  it is soldered to the copper plate. The good thing about this 
  style is that it is very flexible and you are not limited to 
  how your circuit board is designed. It is also a lot easier for
   other people to see how you actually did everything.
