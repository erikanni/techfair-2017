		<p>My name is Erik Anni. I decided to make this project to get more experience in the field of electrical engineering and to learn more about manhattan style soldering. I chose manhattan style soldering because I thought that it was easy to see how the components interconnect and how it works. Through this project I also discovered how to read and follow a schematic. This also helped me get my ham radio Technician licence. My new callsign is KN4APF. The test to get a license required me to know about electrical components, and i think that working on this project made it a lot easier for me.</p>
